Events Management

The motivation is to organize all the events around. from concerte to soccer game in the neighborhood,
to lecture, so the users can see in real time what is going around them.


This project consists of 4 components: 
1) Node Express server -  which handles the api HTTP requests.
2) Node Mailer - Net server, for sending emails to subscribers.
3) MongoDB - the primary db.
4) Elasticsearch - you know, for search.
